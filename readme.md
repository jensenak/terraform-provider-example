Sample Terraform Provider
===

This repo just contains a simple (and useless) terraform provider. This code was originally based off of github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding, though it's been modified so much, I don't know if any of the original code samples remain.

The purpose here is just to show the simplest implementation that actually fulfills all of the requirements (CRUD for the resource and read for the data source). It was a learning experience for me, and I'm making this repo public so that other people have something to look at if they need a simple example.
